# Example input code for the Stucture_Creator program

# To add a new core to the molsimplify program, include:
#	- %core followed by the name of a core
#	- add_core followed by the location of the xyz/mol file
#	- add_con_atom followed by the connecting atom of the core separated by spaces
#	- add_max_dent followed by the maximum denticity of the core
#	- end to close this core

%core Ce
add_core Ce.xyz
add_con_atom 0
add_max_dent 8
end


# To add a core already available in molsimplify and not modify it (such as single atoms/ions), include:
#	- %core followed by the name of the core
#	- end to close this core

%core La
end


# To add a core already available in molsimplify and modify it, include:
#	- %core followed by the name of a core
#	- symmetric followed by symmetric hydrogens
#		These hydrogens must be separated using brackets and spaces
#		Ex: [1 2 3] [4 5 6] for two methyl groups
#	- nonsymmetric followed by nonsymmetric hydrogens
#		These hydrogens must be separated by spaces
#	- all followed by a list of all hydrogens
#		Any hydrogen not already included in the nonsymmetric block
#		will be added if the all keyword is included. 
#		These hydrogens must be separated by spaces
#	- end to close this core

# To add a new ligand to the molsimplify program and modify it, include:
#	- %ligand followed by the name of the core
#	- environment followed by the value of the environment
#		The program loops over any number of different ligand
#		environments and so that must be specified in the input file
#	- ligocc followed by the number of ligands in the complex
#	- symmetric followed by symmetric hydrogens
#               These hydrogens must be separated using brackets and spaces
#               Ex: [1 2 3] [4 5 6] for two methyl groups

#	- add_con_atom followed by the connecting atoms of the ligand

#To add the modifications to be used in the program, include:
